# Loan Default Risk Prediction System with Model Comparison and Web App Deployment

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan. It involves data preprocessing, training and comparing multiple classification models, evaluating their performance, and deploying the best model as a web application.

## Problem Statement
Loan default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions. Accurate prediction helps in minimizing financial losses and optimizing loan portfolios.

## Dataset Description
The project uses a synthetic dataset based on the "Give Me Some Credit" competition structure, containing:
- **Training data**: 150,000 loan applications with 10 features
- **Test data**: 101,503 loan applications
- **Default rate**: ~10.4% (realistic imbalanced dataset)

### Key Features:
- RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines: Credit utilization ratio
- Age: Applicant's age
- NumberOfTime30-59DaysPastDueNotWorse: Past due 30-59 days count
- DebtRatio: Monthly debt payments / monthly income
- MonthlyIncome: Monthly income in dollars
- NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans: Number of open credit lines
- NumberOfTimes90DaysLate: Past due 90+ days count
- NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines: Number of real estate loans
- NumberOfTime60-89DaysPastDueNotWorse: Past due 60-89 days count
- NumberOfDependents: Number of dependents

## Models Compared and Evaluation Metrics
We compared various supervised classification models:
* **Logistic Regression** - ROC AUC: 0.786
* **Decision Tree** - ROC AUC: 0.695
* **Random Forest** - ROC AUC: 0.888
* **XGBoost** - ROC AUC: 0.893 (Best Model)
* **LightGBM** - ROC AUC: 0.892

### Evaluation Metrics:
* **ROC AUC**: Area under the ROC curve
* **Precision-Recall Curve**: For imbalanced dataset evaluation
* **Confusion Matrix**: Classification accuracy breakdown
* **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

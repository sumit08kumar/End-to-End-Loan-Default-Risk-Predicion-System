# End-to-End-Loan-Default-Risk-Predicion-System

## 🔥 **Project:**

**"Loan Default Risk Prediction System with Model Comparison and Web App Deployment"**

---

## 🧠 **Project Idea Overview:**

Build a complete pipeline to predict the **probability of a customer defaulting on a loan**. Use structured tabular data and compare different supervised learning models (classification). The goal is to **create a reliable system**, optimize it, interpret its decisions (XAI), and deploy it as a **Flask/Streamlit web app**.
